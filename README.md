# GarbageCollectorRobot
An autonomous robot car that removes garbage found in its path with the help of robotic arms

## Features
- **Smart Sensors:** Equipped with ultrasonic and infrared sensors, the robot can accurately detect and locate garbage in its vicinity.

- **Flexible Robotic Arm:** With a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, the robot can maneuver and reach debris from various angles.

- **Precise Movement:** Servo motors and servo motor drivers enable precise arm movement, ensuring effective garbage removal.

- **Intelligent Control:** The Arduino Uno board microcontroller efficiently manages all aspects of the robot's operation, from sensor readings to arm control.

### Import Essential Libraries
In order for the Garbage Collector Robot to operate seamlessly, you must include the following two libraries in your code:

PWM Servo Motor Library - :
The PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Servo Motor Library is integral for controlling the movement and positioning of the robotic arm's servo motors. This library facilitates precise control over the degrees of freedom and rotation angles of the arm, enabling accurate garbage collection. You can download this library from link to library download.

AFmotor Library:
The AFmotor Library is another vital component that contributes to the overall functionality of the robot. It aids in managing the servo motors and servo motor drivers, allowing for smooth and coordinated movements of the robotic arm. Ensure you have this library available for integration.
